## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository serves as my organized workspace for **CSCI 1913**.
It includes labs, projects, and personal notes as I build my foundation in algorithms, object-oriented programming, and data structures.

Each folder contains weekly deliverables, practice files, and development experiments — version-controlled for reference and improvement throughout the semester.

## 🧪 Weekly Labs

Hands-on assignments designed to apply lecture concepts and strengthen programming fundamentals.

| **Lab Range** | **Focus**                                | **Language** | **Status** |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Lab 1–3       | Python fundamentals                      | Python       | ✅         |
| Lab 4–6       | Algorithm analysis, sorting, searching   | Python       | ✅         |
| Lab 7–9       | Java syntax, classes, OOP design         | Java         | 🔧         |
| Lab 10–12     | Data structures (lists → stacks → trees) | Java         | x          |

> **Legend:** ✅ = Completed 🔧 = In Progress x = Not Started
